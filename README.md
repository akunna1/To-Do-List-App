# To-Do-List-App
Creating a To Do List App using vue.js and vite

The vue.js code is a combination of JavaScript and HTML.

- JavaScript: The `<script setup>` section contains JavaScript code using Vue's Composition API, which defines the reactive data, computed properties, watchers, and methods for the component.
- HTML: The `<template>` section contains HTML-like syntax that describes the structure of the user interface. This includes elements like `<input>`, `<form>`, `<div>`, and others, which are used to build the layout and elements of the application.

Vue's template syntax is similar to HTML, but it includes additional features like directives (`v-model`, `v-for`, `v-if`, etc.) that allow for reactive and declarative rendering of the DOM based on the component's state.
